1. First thing first, I go in the Models and change all of the Ids with inheriting from : BaseEntity
2. I start implementing the service interfaces
- It is copy paste from the github from the regular auditory classes
3. Now we need to implement the services in the controller, so we can use repository instead of DbContext
- FIRST WE GO TO PROGRAM.CS AND WE REGISTER .AddTransient<interface, implementation> BEFORE var app = builder.Build();
- Then we change the controllers
4. Then we implement the main thing in the view
We send it with ViewBag (the id of the item we add something, and the ids of the things we want to add to the object)
Then we make the form in the View and at the end we do the post method.
Additionally, we need to memorize the user in the MtoN class we make, so we start from the controller, then we go to the service and we keep it in the object.
We just send it from top to bottom
